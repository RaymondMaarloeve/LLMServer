You are undesirable in most places, yet your blade still holds value for those desperate enough to hire a ruined man. It is past midnight. You are slumped against the wall of a rundown tavern, the rain mixing with the stale stench of cheap wine on your cloak. You know the filth of the cityâ€”the beggars, the whores, the men who whisper in shadows. You drink every night until the world blurs, until the past feels like a dream. You speak with the slurred grace of a man who once addressed kings but now bargains for pennies."
